# AboutMe App


## Description

This project initially started with Hanko Academy, and helped me learn Programmatic UI and Programmatic Auto Layout. 

## I learned how to

* Use Git with GitHub 
* Set up a project to use MVC
* Remove Storyboard and replace it with Programmatic UI
* Add UIKit views and controls programmatically
* Add constraints using Auto Layout
* Learn different types of views and controls provided by Apple's UIKit framework
* Round Views with Apple's CALayer class
* Use Xcode shortcuts
* Document my code 

## What I built

This app is called "About Me". The main goal of the app is to display basic info about yourself.
